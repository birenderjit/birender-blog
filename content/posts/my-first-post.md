I finally set up the blog on Hugo. I had a blog on blogger and had not posted anything in that for many years. I think the last time I posted something on that blog was in 2012. 

I have been meaning to start blogging again and especially after reading The Coding Career Handbook by [swyx](https://www.swyx.io/) where he talks about [Learn In public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

Decided to go with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as I started learning [golang](https://golang.org/). Hoping to be able to learn the details of writing a app in go by playing around with Hugo.

This blog will contain my writings about all things tech and from time to time non tech as well.
